            <h2 className="section-title">What are probiotics?</h2>
            <p>
              Probiotics is an umbrella term for the types of beneficial live microorganisms (or microbes) 
              found in products such as fermented foods and yogurt. When consumed, probiotics can contribute 
              microbes to the number that naturally live in your gut and elsewhere. This community of all 
              microbes, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, is known as the microbiome.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recent research focuses on how changes in the microbiome might result in health benefits. 
              For example, healthier microorganisms can improve your digestion and immune response. In turn, 
              this may prevent conditions such as periodontal disease and constipation, and ease the symptoms 
              of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
            </p>
            <p>
              But the health benefits of probiotics aren't limited to your gut. Probiotics may also help to 
              improve your heart health, mood, skin, and cognitive functioning, as well as counteract the 
              negative effects of antibiotics. Probiotics could even potentially play a role in managing 
              diabetes and types of cancer and dementia.

            <p>
              Your digestive tract and brain are connected, so what affects one can also affect the other. 
              Researchers sometimes refer to this as the gut-brain connection.

                  The digestive tract produces chemicals that regulate your mood, including serotonin and 
                  dopamine, which are crucial for mental well-being.

                  Incorporate yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, and kombucha into your meals.

                  If choosing supplements, look for products with multiple strains, high CFU counts, and 
                  third-party testing for quality assurance.

                  Prebiotics are fibers that feed probiotics. Include foods like garlic, onions, bananas,

              Probiotics offer a fascinating intersection between nutrition, gut health, and overall well-being. 
              The growing research on the microbiome and gut-brain connection reveals how these beneficial 
              microorganisms can influence everything from digestion and immunity to mood and cognitive function.
            </p>
            <p>
              While probiotics aren't a magic solution for all health concerns, incorporating them into a 
              balanced diet can contribute to better physical and mental health. Remember that consistency 
              is key, and combining probiotics with prebiotic foods creates the optimal environment for these 
              beneficial bacteria to thrive. As with any dietary change, it's wise to start slowly and pay 
              attention to how your body responds.
