            <h2 className="section-title">What is burnout?</h2>
            <p>
              Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and 
              prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to 
              meet constant demands. As the stress continues, you begin to lose the interest and motivation 
              that led you to take on a certain role in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Burnout reduces productivity and saps your energy, leaving you feeling increasingly helpless, 
              hopeless, cynical, and resentful. Eventually, you may feel like you have nothing more to give.
            </p>
            <p>
              The negative effects of burnout spill over into every area of lifeâ€”including your home, work, 
              and social life. Burnout can also cause long-term changes to your body that make you vulnerable 
              to illnesses like colds and flu.

              Burnout recovery is a process that requires time, patience, and consistent effort. While the 
              journey may seem daunting, especially when you're already feeling exhausted and overwhelmed,

            </p>
            <p>
              Remember that recovery involves addressing both the symptoms and the underlying causes of 
              burnout. This may include setting better boundaries, learning to say no, prioritizing self-care, 
              seeking professional help if needed, and making changes to your work or lifestyle that support 
              long-term health and happiness. With the right approach and support, it's possible to overcome 
              burnout, regain your energy and enthusiasm, and build a more sustainable way of living that 
              protects against future burnout episodes.
