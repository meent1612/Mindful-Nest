                <h2>What is burnout?</h2>
                <p>
                  Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands. As the stress continues, you begin to lose the interest and motivation that led you to take on a certain role in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Burnout reduces productivity and saps your energy, leaving you feeling increasingly helpless, hopeless, cynical, and resentful. Eventually, you may feel like you have nothing more to give.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The negative effects of burnout spill over into every area of life—including your home, work, and social life. Burnout can also cause long-term changes to your body that make you vulnerable to illnesses like colds and flu. Because of its many consequences, it's important to deal with burnout right away.
                </p>

                <h2>Are you on the road to burnout?</h2>
                <p>
                  You may be on the road to burnout if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Every day is a bad day.</li>
                  <li>Caring about your work or home life seems like a total waste of energy.</li>
                  <li>You're exhausted all the time.</li>
                  <li>The majority of your day is spent on tasks you find either mind-numbingly dull or overwhelming.</li>
                  <li>You feel like nothing you do makes a difference or is appreciated.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Signs and symptoms of burnout</h2>
                <p>
                  Most of us have days when we feel helpless, overloaded, or unappreciated—when dragging ourselves out of bed requires the determination of Hercules. If you feel like this most of the time, however, you may be burned out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Burnout is a gradual process. It doesn't happen overnight, but it can creep up on you. The signs and symptoms are subtle at first, but become worse as time goes on. Think of the early symptoms as red flags that something is wrong that needs to be addressed. If you pay attention and actively reduce your stress, you can prevent a major breakdown. If you ignore them, you'll eventually burn out.
                </p>

                <h3>Physical signs and symptoms of burnout</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Feeling tired and drained most of the time.</li>
                  <li>Lowered immunity, frequent illnesses.</li>
                  <li>Frequent headaches or muscle pain.</li>
                  <li>Change in appetite or sleep habits.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Emotional signs and symptoms of burnout</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Sense of failure and self-doubt.</li>
                  <li>Feeling helpless, trapped, and defeated.</li>
                  <li>Detachment, feeling alone in the world.</li>

                  <li>Decreased satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Behavioral signs and symptoms of burnout</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Withdrawing from responsibilities.</li>
                  <li>Isolating from others.</li>
                  <li>Procrastinating, taking longer to get things done.</li>
                  <li>Using food, drugs, or alcohol to cope.</li>
                  <li>Taking frustrations out on others.</li>
                  <li>Skipping work or coming in late and leaving early.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The difference between stress and burnout</h2>
                <p>
                  Burnout may be the result of unrelenting stress, but it isn't the same as too much stress. Stress, by and large, involves too much: too many pressures that demand too much of you physically and mentally. However, stressed people can still imagine that if they can just get everything under control, they'll feel better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Burnout, on the other hand, is about not enough. Being burned out means feeling empty and mentally exhausted, devoid of motivation, and beyond caring. People experiencing burnout often don't see any hope of positive change in their situations. If excessive stress feels like you're drowning in responsibilities, burnout is a sense of being all dried up. And while you're usually aware of being under a lot of stress, you don't always notice burnout when it happens.
                </p>

                <h2>Burnout vs. depression</h2>
                <p>
                  Burnout and depression can also be difficult to tell apart, and some of the symptoms can overlap. For example, whether you're depressed or burned out, you might feel exhausted or have a hard time focusing. Burnout can also be a risk factor for depression. However, the two conditions have important differences.
                </p>

                <h3>Burnout</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Not diagnosed as a medical condition.</li>
                  <li>Caused by external stressors, such as work, parenting, or caregiving tasks.</li>
                  <li>May not have energy for hobbies or interests.</li>
                  <li>Negative feelings may primarily relate to work, school, parenting, caregiving, or other specific source of stress.</li>
                  <li>Recovery involves managing stressors, such as taking a vacation from work or delegating caregiving tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Depression</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Medically diagnosed condition.</li>
                  <li>Caused by a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors.</li>
                  <li>May no longer find enjoyment in hobbies or interests.</li>
                  <li>Negative feelings may relate to every area of life.</li>
                  <li>Depression treatment may involve medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Stages of burnout</h2>
                <p>
                  Researchers have used several models to chart the development of burnout symptoms. For example, one model follows 12 stages, starting with a desire to prove oneself in a specific task and then advancing to unhealthier behaviors, such as neglecting self-care. Eventually, this leads toward the later stages, including feelings of emptiness and depression.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another model simplifies burnout progression to five stages:
                </p>

                <h3>5 stages of burnout</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Stage 1 (Honeymoon Phase):</strong> You feel committed to an endeavor, whether you've just gotten a new job, a promotion, enrolled in a class, or started parenting or caregiving. You're ready to accept new responsibilities and eager to prove yourself. You may feel creative, productive, and energized.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stage 2 (Stress Onset):</strong> As the stress of your new responsibilities begins to take its toll, you start to neglect your self-care needs. Your sleep quality diminishes. Anxiety shows up more often, along with irritability, headaches, and fatigue. You become less productive, have a harder time focusing, and try to avoid making decisions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stage 3 (Chronic Stress):</strong> You're consistently tired and feel cynical or apathetic. Social issues can also crop up. You may withdraw from coworkers or feel resentful toward your loved ones. You might frequently procrastinate or use drugs or alcohol to self-medicate, even as you deny the problem.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stage 4 (Burnout):</strong> At this point, you feel pessimistic about the future and obsessed with any problems that crop up. You're neglecting your personal health, and that comes with physical problems like gastrointestinal issues and chronic headaches. You're plagued by self-doubt and look to socially isolate yourself.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stage 5 (Habitual Burnout):</strong> Your sense of well-being reaches a low. You're always sad and mentally and physically fatigued. Depression may develop here.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Causes of burnout</h2>
                <p>
                  Burnout often stems from your job. But anyone who feels overworked and undervalued is at risk for burnout, from the hardworking office worker who hasn't had a vacation in years, to the frazzled stay-at-home mom tending to kids, housework, and an aging parent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But burnout is not caused solely by stressful work or too many responsibilities. Other factors contribute to burnout, including your lifestyle and personality traits. In fact, what you do in your downtime and how you look at the world can play just as big of a role in causing overwhelming stress as work or home demands.
                </p>

                <h3>Work-related causes of burnout</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Feeling like you have little or no control over your work.</li>
                  <li>Lack of recognition or reward for good work.</li>
                  <li>Unclear or overly demanding job expectations.</li>
                  <li>Doing work that's monotonous or unchallenging.</li>
                  <li>Working in a chaotic or high-pressure environment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Lifestyle causes of burnout</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Working too much, without enough time for socializing or relaxing.</li>
                  <li>Lack of close, supportive relationships.</li>
                  <li>Taking on too many responsibilities, without enough help from others.</li>
                  <li>Not getting enough sleep.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Personality traits can contribute to burnout</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Perfectionistic tendencies; nothing is ever good enough.</li>
                  <li>Pessimistic view of yourself and the world.</li>
                  <li>The need to be in control; reluctance to delegate to others.</li>
                  <li>High-achieving, Type A personality.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to deal with burnout</h2>
                <p>
                  Whether you recognize the warning signs of impending burnout or you're already past the breaking point, trying to push through the exhaustion and continuing as you have been will only cause further emotional and physical damage. Now is the time to pause and change direction by learning how you can help yourself overcome burnout and feel healthy and positive again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dealing with burnout requires the "Three R" approach:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Recognize.</strong> Watch for the warning signs of burnout.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reverse.</strong> Undo the damage by seeking support and managing stress.</li>
                  <li><strong>Resilience.</strong> Build your resilience to stress by taking care of your physical and emotional health.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  The following tips for preventing or dealing with burnout can help you cope with symptoms and regain your energy, focus, and sense of well-being.
                </p>

                <h3>Tip 1: Turn to other people</h3>
                <p>
                  When you're burned out, problems seem insurmountable, everything looks bleak, and it's difficult to muster up the energy to care, let alone take action to help yourself. But you have a lot more control over stress than you may think. There are positive steps you can take to deal with overwhelming stress and get your life back into balance. One of the most effective is to reach out to others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Social contact is nature's antidote to stress and talking face to face with a good listener is one of the fastest ways to calm your nervous system and relieve stress. The person you talk to doesn't have to be able to "fix" your stressors; they just have to be a good listener, someone who'll listen attentively without becoming distracted or expressing judgment.
                </p>

                <h3>Tip 2: Reframe the way you look at work</h3>
                <p>
                  Whether you have a job that leaves you rushed off your feet or one that is monotonous and unfulfilling, the most effective way to combat job burnout is to quit and find a job you love instead. Of course, for many of us changing job or career is far from being a practical solution, we're grateful just to have work that pays the bills. Whatever your situation, though, there are still steps you can take to improve your state of mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Try to find some value in your work. Even in some mundane jobs, you can often focus on how your role helps others, for example, or provides a much-needed product or service. Focus on aspects of the job that you do enjoy, even if it's just chatting with your coworkers at lunch. Changing your attitude towards your job can help you regain a sense of purpose and control.
                </p>

                <h3>Tip 3: Reevaluate your priorities</h3>
                <p>
                  Burnout is an undeniable sign that something important in your life is not working. Take time to think about your hopes, goals, and dreams. Are you neglecting something that is truly important to you? This can be an opportunity to rediscover what really makes you happy and to slow down and give yourself time to rest, reflect, and heal.
                </p>

                <h3>Tip 4: Make exercise a priority</h3>
                <p>
                  Even though it may be the last thing you feel like doing when you're burned out, exercise is a powerful antidote to stress and burnout. It's also something you can do right now to boost your mood.
                </p>

                <h3>Tip 5: Support your mood and energy levels with a healthy diet</h3>
                <p>
                  What you put in your body can have a huge impact on your mood and energy levels throughout the day.
                </p>

                <h2>Dealing with burnout symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                  Since it's not a diagnosable medical condition, burnout is a term that's widely misused. But if you recognize the symptoms of burnout, such as feeling mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted, it's critical you pause, reevaluate your priorities, and make changes in your life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the right treatment and support, you can recover from burnout, regain your energy and enthusiasm, and feel more hopeful.
