            question: "What are the different types of depression?",
            answer: "Major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), psychotic depression, peripartum (postpartum) depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and situational depression. Each type has unique symptoms, causes, and treatment approaches."
        },
        {
            question: "Pornography and depression: Is there a link?",
            answer: "Research shows a complex relationship between pornography consumption and depression. For some individuals, excessive use may correlate with depressive symptoms, potentially due to feelings of guilt, shame, or social isolation. However, causation isn't clearly established, and many factors contribute to both depression and patterns of media consumption."
        },
        {
            question: "Am I depressed?",
            answer: "Only a qualified healthcare professional can provide a diagnosis, but common signs include persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep or appetite, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide. If these symptoms last for two weeks or more and interfere with daily functioning, it's important to seek professional help."
        },
        {
            question: "What is clinical depression?",
            answer: "Clinical depression, or major depressive disorder, is a serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, think, and act. It causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. It can lead to emotional and physical problems and decrease ability to function at work and home."
        },
        {
            question: "What does depression feel like?",
            answer: "Depression often feels like an overwhelming emptiness, numbness, or heaviness. Many describe it as being trapped in darkness or carrying a heavy weight. It can involve emotional pain, mental fog, physical exhaustion, and a sense of isolation even when surrounded by others. Experiences vary widely among individuals."
