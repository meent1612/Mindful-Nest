      question: "How is suicide prevented?",
      answer: "Suicide prevention involves multiple strategies: increasing access to mental health care, reducing access to lethal means, promoting connectedness, teaching coping and problem-solving skills, and identifying and supporting people at risk. Crisis lines, therapy, medication, and community support all play crucial roles in prevention."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I text 741 741?",
      answer: "When you text 741 741, you'll be connected to a trained crisis counselor from the Crisis Text Line. The counselor will listen without judgment, help you process your feelings, and work with you to create a safety plan. The service is free, confidential, and available 24/7 for anyone in crisis."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I say to someone who almost killed themselves?",
      answer: "Express care and concern without judgment. Say things like: 'I'm so glad you're still here,' 'Your life matters to me,' 'I'm here for you,' and 'You're not alone.' Avoid minimizing their experience or offering simplistic solutions. Listen more than you speak, and encourage them to seek professional help."
    },
    {
      question: "What does suicide prevention mean?",
      answer: "Suicide prevention refers to collective efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide through preventive measures. This includes public awareness campaigns, school-based programs, screening for at-risk individuals, treatment of mental disorders, responsible media reporting, and restricting access to common methods of suicide."
    },
    {
      question: "What is suicide ideation?",
