      question: "What are the signs and symptoms of anxiety?",
      answer: "Common signs and symptoms of anxiety include excessive worrying, restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep problems, panic attacks, and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations. Physical symptoms can include rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, and gastrointestinal issues."
    },
    {
      question: "What is agoraphobia?",
      answer: "Agoraphobia is a type of anxiety disorder where you fear and avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless, or embarrassed. People with agoraphobia often avoid crowded places, open spaces, public transportation, or being outside of their home alone."
    },
    {
      question: "What medications work for anxiety?",
      answer: "Common medications for anxiety include SSRIs (like sertraline, escitalopram), SNRIs (like venlafaxine, duloxetine), benzodiazepines (for short-term use, like alprazolam, clonazepam), buspirone, and beta-blockers (like propranolol for physical symptoms). Medication should always be prescribed and monitored by a healthcare professional."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a panic attack and anxiety attack?",
      answer: "Panic attacks are sudden, intense episodes of fear that peak within minutes, with physical symptoms like heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Anxiety attacks typically build more gradually, are less intense but longer-lasting, and are often related to a specific stressor. Panic attacks can occur unexpectedly, while anxiety attacks are usually triggered by perceived threats."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use CBD for anxiety?",
      answer: "Some research suggests CBD may help reduce anxiety symptoms, but evidence is still limited. CBD appears to interact with serotonin receptors in the brain, which may explain its potential anti-anxiety effects. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before using CBD, as it can interact with other medications and its quality isn't regulated by the FDA."
