            <p>
              Exercise is not just about aerobic capacity and muscle size. Sure, exercise can 
              improve your physical health and your physique, trim your waistline, improve your 
              sex life, and even add years to your life. But that's not what motivates most 
              people to stay active.
            </p>
            <p>
              People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense 
              of well-being. They feel more energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, 
              have sharper memories, and feel more relaxed and positive about themselves and 
              their lives. And it's also a powerful medicine for many common mental health challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regular exercise can have a profoundly positive impact on depression, anxiety, and ADHD. 
              It also relieves stress, improves memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts your 
              overall mood. And you don't have to be a fitness fanatic to reap the benefits. 
              Research indicates that modest amounts of exercise can make a real difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter your age or fitness level, you can learn to use exercise as a powerful 
              tool to deal with mental health problems, improve your energy and outlook, and 
              get more out of life.

            <h2 className="section-title">Benefits of exercise on depression</h2>
            <p>
              Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively 
              as antidepressant medicationâ€”but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, 
              a 2019 study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running 
              for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour may reduce the risk of major depression 
              by 26 percent. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows 
              that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.

                  Exercise can serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break

            <p>
              Exercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension 
              and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through 
              the release of endorphins. Anything that gets you moving can help, but you'll get 
              a bigger benefit if you pay attention instead of zoning out.

              Ever noticed how your body feels when you're under stress? Your muscles may be tense, 
              especially in your face, neck, and shoulders, leaving you with back or neck pain, 
              or painful headaches. You may feel a tightness in your chest, a pounding pulse, 
              or muscle cramps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exercising is an effective way to break the stress cycle. As well as releasing endorphins 
              in the brain, physical activity helps to relax the muscles and relieve tension in 
              the body. Since the body and mind are so closely linked, when your body feels better 
              so, too, will your mind.
